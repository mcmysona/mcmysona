# Hi — I'm mcmysona 👋

I'm a student and developer who documents coursework and small projects focused on imperative programming and image processing. I keep course materials, weekly labs and a larger image-processing project here.

## Quick summary
- Primary language: English (French translation in README.fr.md)
- Repository highlights: Programmation-Impératives (contains Semaine1…Semaine8), Projet-Image
- Main themes: imperative programming, algorithms, data structures, image formats and basic image filters, testing, and code organization

## Skills
- Languages: C++, Python
- Image / data tools: custom PPM/PGM readers &amp; C++ image-processing code, small helper Python scripts (open_ppm.py), Makefiles, jupytext (notebooks as text)
- Course / teaching tools: Jupyter / jupytext, Markdown lessons and TDs
- Dev tools: Git, GitHub (imported subrepos from GitLab), Make
- Practices: incremental development, examples &amp; exercises, exercise-driven learning, small testable programs

## Selected projects 
- Projet-Image
  A C++ image-processing project. Implements PPM/PGM/PBM readers/writers and a set of example algorithms: thresholding, Sobel edge detection, superpixels, renormalization, simple filters and small demos. Includes a Makefile, documentation (partie-*.md) and a short report.

- Programmation-Impératives
  The course material for an introductory imperative programming class. Mostly written as Markdown lessons and Jupyter-compatible content (jupytext). Contains course scripts (course.py, jupylates_course.py), ontology/config files and media for lectures.

- Weekly assignments (Semaine1–Semaine8) — grouped under Programmation-Impératives
  Weekly labs and exercises imported from a GitLab group.
  Early weeks focus on Python/Jupyter basics and algorithmic thinking; later weeks include many C++ exercises and example programs (loops, functions, arrays, file I/O, 2D arrays, small projects like Minesweeper).
  These repos contain TDs, course notes, example programs and small exercises with step-by-step explanations.

## Fun skills / side projects
- LaTeX &amp; templates
  I use LaTeX extensively and I've created custom templates for class materials and reports (examples: templates for my two computer-science courses this semester). I maintain reusable templates for assignments and reports.

- Linux &amp; Bash
  I'm learning Linux and Bash: daily shell tasks, simple automation scripts, and common GNU utilities.
